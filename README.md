# gandas: Test lib based on pandas, the "powerful Python data analysis toolkit"

## What is it

**gandas** is an experimental Groovy package intended to recreate useful features from the well-known pandas python library.

**pandas** is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data
structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data both
easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for
doing practical, **real world** data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has
the broader goal of becoming **the most powerful and flexible open source data
analysis / manipulation tool available in any language**. It is already well on
its way toward this goal.
